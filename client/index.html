Wall Street is [hotly speculating](https://www.ft.com/content/4b581972-09c5-11e7-97d1-5e720a26771b) about which consumer group Kraft Heinz will set it sights on next. Potential targets, however, do not match the [$150bn price tag of the Unilever juggernaut](https://www.ft.com/content/d846766e-f81b-11e6-bd4e-68d53499ed71). Yet plenty of blockbuster deals remain.  Below is a calculator for you to choose the financial limits behind a potential takeover, including the levels of debt and equity to fund the deal.

While financial metrics are key to how Kraft Heinz will assess any dealmaking, potential for cost cuts and strategic merits will vary for different targets and should be taken into consideration.

Colgate-Palmolive and Kimberly-Clark, for example, would provide a shift into the personal care and household products business. Mondelez, a snacks business, derives three-quarters of its sales from outside the US.

The audacious Unilever approach took the market by surprise. Another bold play very well could be coming. Wall Street watchers can be confident, however, that Kraft Heinz and it backers, 3G Capital and Warren Buffett, will not sit still.
