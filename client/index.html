Now that Kraft Heinz will no longer pursue Unilever, Wall Street is speculating on what consumer company it will prey on next. The firms that are most speculated about do not come anywhere near the $150bn price tag of the European juggernaut. But with values ranging between $30bn and $90bn there are plenty of blockbuster targets remaining that will require significant debt, new shares issued to 3G Capital and Warren Buffett and even new shares issued to target shareholders.

And while financial metrics are key to how Kraft Heinz thinks about dealmaking, the strategic merits of each of these target companies is different. Colgate-Palmolive and Kimberly-Clark would be shifts into personal care and household products. Mondelez, a snacks business, derives a three-quarters of its sales from outside the US. The audacious Unilever approach took the market by surprise. Another bold play very well could be coming. We can confident, however, that Kraft Heinz and it backers, 3G Capital and Kraft Heinz, will not sit still.
